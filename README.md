## About CJC Toolbox

CJC Toolbox is a software that contains all CJC Apps. You don't need to download all the apps one by one. Instead, you only need to download the toolbox to have all the softwares by CJC.

## What you can do and you can't do with the code

CJC Toolbox is an open-source software. Below is the list of what you can do and you can't do with the source code.

**You can**:

+ Use a part of the code in your program. If you do this, don't forget to credit us in your program.
+ Share the code with other people on the Internet (outside github). Also, you need to credit us if you do this.
+ Create versions of other platforms such as Linux, Mac OS, Sun OS, Nintendo Switch and so on.

**You can't**:

+ Clone this project and change its name to "{Your Name}'s Toolbox". It's meaningless.
+ Create versions in other languages such as C++, Python, Java and so on, but on Windows. It's also meaningless.
